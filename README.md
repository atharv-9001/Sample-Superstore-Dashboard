# Sample-Superstore-Dashboard
Used a standard retail “Superstore” dataset and built a full interactive dashboard to analyze sales, profit, orders, products, and regional performance — simulating a real-world retail analytics environment. 
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA): explored product categories, sales by category/sub-category, regional/segment sales distribution, and shipping methods to understand business trends.
Created visual reports showing key business metrics (KPIs) — total sales, profit, quantity sold, sales by region, top-selling products/categories, and performance over time — providing actionable insights for management or stakeholders. 
Implemented interactive dashboard features: filters (region, category, product type), drill-down capability (region → product → time), and multiple views (charts, maps, tables) for deep analysis — improving readability and decision-making. 
Demonstrated skills in data visualization, business intelligence, data-driven storytelling, and tools like Tableau — essential for roles in data analytics, BI, and reporting.
